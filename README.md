Deep Learning for Classification and Severity Estimation of Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress
After reading the technical task, I followed the R&D procedures to solve the problem based on a scientific ground, so in the beginning, I tried to scrape the internet to find some research papers that deal with the same problem or a similar one, and fortunately, I found good research published in the recent years, specifically in 2020 (the research paper attached with this e-mail), also I found a repo  for its implementation here in this link address: [lara2018](https://github.com/esgario/lara2018), but I didn't benefit from this implementation as I did with the research paper 

   And due to the intersection of the task available time with my workdays, I tried to submit the best and fastest effort to implement such a paper, and as there was not any mentioned technology or models or methods with the task description I saw that I can benefit from this and implement the method in the paper with MathWorks tools, which assists me only to submit the work within the time limitations and the available free time to me out of my official working days.

   But I want to hint that I can implement it with other technologies and multi-choice of platforms like python, or c++, so kindly check  my work thinking, procedures, and method, and I suppose to follow up the rest of the interviews and employment's operations, and if we had a deal to begin working together, we can follow any needed technology with the same task or another in the evaluation period


Deliverables:
\n 1- a notebook code file in .mlx format
2- a pdf presentation for the notebook code with the outputs
3- CSV file for the output
